Our guest this week is Dylan Baddour, an acclaimed journalist from Austin, Texas reporting on the Venezuelan migration crisis. Based in Bogota, Colombia, Dylan's reporting has been published in The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal, Vox, NPR among many other publishers. In 2017, he left behind his seat at the Houston Chronicle business desk to try his luck as a freelancer in South America. He talks with us on a recent visit home to Austin on his adventurous life reporting from the front lines and his future aspirations. We go straight to the heart of the matter in this thought-provoking, engaging discussion and by the end of it, Jay is egging Dylan to publish a book on his adventures!
