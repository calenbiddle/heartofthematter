Stick with Yarn, not npm


Install node.js. Best way to do that is with brew

And then don't install node directly but instead install node version manager, nvm

`brew install nvm`

then with nvm, install latest node: 
`nvm install --lts`
verify installation: 
`node -v && npm -v`
Then,in project directory, install node modules with $ `npm ci`
then run the project with $ `npm start`
Should be running at http://localhost:8000 and will update when changes are saved
Ctrl + C to stop the process
